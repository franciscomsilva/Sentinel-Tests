Feature: Refresh Data
  As an user (authenticated or not)
  I want to refresh the dashboard data
  So that I can verify that it is in fact the most recent

  Scenario: Title of your scenario outline
    Given I am at the dashboard
    When I swipe from top to bottom
    Then I verify that the dashboard data was refreshed
